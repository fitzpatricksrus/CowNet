    if you are in the game world, you are in the game.
    There is a lounging cycle between each game where people can
      change team
      choose classes
    You can only enter the games during the lounging cycle
    if you are not in the game you are a spectator
    you do not retain inventory between games
    you can not bring inventory into the game world
    inventory gathered in a game can not be taken off world

    at the end of the lounge cycle, the teams are set
    players may not enter a game after it has started [what about jail - which could be a long game]
    each game has a time limit.  If nobody has won by the time limit the game ends
